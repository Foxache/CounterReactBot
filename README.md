# Setup

All this is covered in the video on Dingus Dongulus

sadly theres some setup to do first.

Go to steam and open "local files" on Steam.
This will open CS:GO directory.
from there go to:
game -> csgo -> cfg
In that folder , paste in the gamestate config file provided.

Next you need to change the STEAMID64 with your own in the config file.

Make sure you have python and PIP installed and run:
py -m pip install pynput flask 
Thats the setup done!


# Bug Reporting and FAQ
Any bugs? Not surprised , contact me on discord and I will sigh and reluctantly fix it: Foxache#0100

FAQ:

Q) It doesnt seem to be doing anything! (no logs after the red line in the terminal instance)

A) Check you placed the CFG in the Counter Strike 2 Directory , not the Counter Strike (og) directory
and you replaced the Steamid With you own. (did you save it?)
